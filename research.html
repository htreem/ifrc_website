    <h2 class="subheading">Comparison to the IFRC GO platform</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class=" col-lg-3">
      </div>
      <div class="text-col col-lg-6">
        <p>Our project aims to be the backbone of an online resource very
           similar to IFRC GO. Our project requirements only include the
            backend (obtaining, merging, and analysing the data) and no front end
             (the actual display of the data on some sort of website).
        </p> 
        <p>
          The IFRC GO platform’s goal is to make disaster data readily accessible to IFRC responders worldwide to make more informed decisions[1]. The information available on the 
          platform is reliant on data provided by their humanitarian partners and on-site volunteers. It displays all this data in a in a clear and easy to read manner for the 
          general public to utilise[1].
        </p>
        <p>The main features of the IFRC GO platform, which we are trying to mimic and provide, is their ability to coherently present important real time statistical data 
          from around the world in a clear and concise manner. However, instead of being dependant on reported data from on-site volunteers, 
          the data we are processing are from multiple online sources.</p>
      </div>
      <div class=" col-lg-3">

    <h2 class="subheading">Database Structure and Distribution</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class=" col-lg-3">
      </div>
      <div class="text-col col-lg-6">
        <p>There were multiple solutions to approaches to analysing and processing the raw data to obtain more 
          useful information. But first thing we had to decide as a team was what distribution was going to 
          represent our data. We were going to go with a normal distribution approach at first, but after 
          consulting a team of data scientists from the UN, we were advised to implement a different type 
          of distribution as disasters are typically not normally distributed. After doing some research[2],
           [3], we opted to use bootstrapping to get the data shaped as close as possible to a normal distribution. 
           We were thinking about implementing other types of distributions, like a zero-inflated negative binomial 
           distribution model, but this was outside the scope of our prior statistical background.</p>
        <p>We have several data structures to implement to store our merged data. Possible data structures consist 
          of linked lists, hash tables, trees etc. A linked list would provide for convenient addition and removal
           of elements and can be easily implemented[4]. However, accessing information in a linked list can be very
            time consuming as nodes can only be accessed sequentially[4]. A hash table is able to very efficiently 
            access information with a constant time complexity[4], [5]. However, hash tables have a chance of creating
             duplicate keys, especially as we deal with larger amounts of data[4]. Our final data structure to take into
              consideration is a tree. A tree would be able to showcase the relationship between the different information
               we have[4]. An n-ary tree would also require less space as no extra links between nodes are required[6]. 
               The downside to a tree is that iterating through a tree would be more complex to implement compared to linked lists and hash tables[4].</p>
        <p>To represent the final set of data in a table format, it made most sense to implement a 2D array.</p>

      <div class="text-col col-lg-6">
        <p>Our approach is to use python as it is the most intuitive for both the 
          data scraping and cleaning. It was also the 
          programming language our group was the most familiar with, having 
          experienced using it in past projects.</p>

        <p>Pandas were used for easy and efficient dataframe manipulation. 
          Because we need to download and merge different sources of data, os/sys is also employed to navigate between directories.</p>
        <p>For data scraping, the requests library is used to open html files and to identify download links. Selenium is also employed to navigate through multiple webpages. 
           Pycountry is an important library involved in data cleaning; it helps translate country names into their respective ISO-3 codes.</p>
        <p>The abc (abstract class) library is also used to avoid code duplication and ensure subclass consistency. </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Solution Summary</h2>

      </div>
      <div class="text-col col-lg-6">
        <p>All in all, the approach we took was to use python as our main programming language,
          representing the raw data in a in a normal distribution (shaped via bootstrapping) and implementing
          said libraries in our code. We will represent the merged raw data in a unique tree structure, as time
          complexity was of little concern, and the final dataset with the processed data would be situated in a
          2D array.</p>
